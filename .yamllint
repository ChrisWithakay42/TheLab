# .yamllint

# This configuration file for yamllint extends the default ruleset
# but downgrades common stylistic issues from 'error' to 'warning'.
# This allows the CI pipeline to pass while still notifying developers
# of potential improvements.

# Inherit all the default rules from yamllint.

# Define specific rule overrides.
rules:
  # Downgrade line-length from an error to a warning.
  # You can also customize the max length. 80 is very restrictive.

  # Downgrade indentation from an error to a warning.
